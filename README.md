Got it 👍 since you don’t want **Docker**, I’ll adjust the **README.md** so it’s only for **local installation (Flask + Streamlit)**.

Here’s the cleaned-up version:

# 🧠 AI Smart Email Reply Generator

An AI-powered application that generates **smart, professional replies** to received emails.  
It uses **Flask** as the backend (API with LLM integration), **Streamlit** as the frontend (UI), and the **Groq LLaMA-3 model** for natural language generation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Generate professional replies to incoming emails.
- Choose different tones (Formal, Friendly, Apologetic, Assertive, Neutral).
- Summarize incoming emails.
- Reply based on full conversation threads.
- Sentiment analysis of emails.
- Email composer from bullet points.

## ⚙️ Installation (Local)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-email-generator.git
cd ai-email-generator
````

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Run the backend:

```bash
python app.py
```

Backend will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

---

### 3. Frontend setup

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run email_app.py
```

Frontend will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8501`

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Your API keys must be stored in `.env` (never commit real keys).

Example (`backend/.env.example`):

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* **Do not commit `.env`** → only `.env.example`.
* If you leak your key, revoke it immediately.
* Works best with Groq LLaMA-3 models.
